<h3>🎉 What to Bring</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your Amazing Self
        Because what’s a party without the life of it? Don’t worry if you're late – just blame the traffic (even if you walked). 😎</li>
    <li> A Gift (Optional... but Highly Appreciated 😅)    
        Totally not expecting anything… unless it’s cake-scented candles, books, or something I can brag about on Instagram.</li>
    <li>Your Appetite
        There will be food. Lots of it. Come hungry or face the guilt of not being able to try all 5 types of chips I bought. 🍕🍩</li>
</ul>

<h3>This is where you need to come</h3>
